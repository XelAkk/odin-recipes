    <p>This is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-q14tZeXiU">chili oil recipe</a> from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JoshuaWeissman">Joshua Weissman's</a> youtube channel in text form</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1l of neutral tasting oil (peanut/sunflower seed/canola)</li>
        <li>6 star anise</li>
        <li>6 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>10g coriander seeds</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>20g Sichuan peppercorns</li>
        <li>4 black cardamom </li>
        <li>110g Sichuan chili flakes (can use regular chili flakes instead)</li>
        <li>10g salt</li>
        <li>14g black vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dishes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 big metal bowl</li>
        <li>1 medium saucepan</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to cook:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add anise, garlic, coriander, cinnamon, cardamom and Sichuan peppercorns into a pot together with all of your oil.</li>
        <li>Heat the pot with spices in it up to 115 degrees celsius and let it simmer for 2 hours (at some point garlic will turn brown and you will have to take it out).</li>
        <li>Add all of chili flakes together with salt and vinegar into a bowl and thoroughly mix everything together.</li>
        <li>Once 2 hours have passed heat the pot up to 140-145 degrees and immediately pour it into your bowl through a strainer (<strong>be careful</strong> as it will foam up <em>a lot</em>). </li>
        <li>The oil is ready! Let it cool, transfer it into jars and keep it in the fridge.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How to eat:</h3>
    <p>I add this oil to <em>everything</em>. It gives food a very pleasant aroma and some heat. I would recommend you add it to dumplings (or even better gyoza), soups and pasta. I even tried it on some vanilla ice cream and it was a fun combination between sweet, cold and spicy, hot oil :P</p>
